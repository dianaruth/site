I consider this to be my first web project and completing this website helped further my passion for web design and development.",

The soil readings were taken using a hardware system designed by our team and pushed to the database using a microcontroller. I created this web application that pulled raw soil readings from a database and displayed the most recent readings as well as graphs of the readings over time.",

It focused on full stack web development to build an IMDB-style database for a topic of our choosing. We made an application about people, planets and species in the Star Wars universe using data scraped from an online Star Wars data repository called 'The Star Wars API', located at www.swapi.co, as well as images and descriptions from Wikia. This application uses AngularJS, Flask, Docker, and PostgreSQL. Unfortunately the application is no longer running because it was hosted on a Rackspace server that we no longer pay for, but the source code is all available on my GitHub page. My responsibilities for this project included the UI design and implementation and the front end AngularJS logic.",

I love to cook so I wanted a way to be able to find recipes based on only the ingredients I had in my kitchen, so I could avoid a trip to the grocery store. I decided to make this web app to practice my front-end development with AngularJS as well as my web design skills. I designed the entire UI and created the graphics using Adobe Illustrator. The app uses the Yummly API for recipe search and then displays the results all on a single page application. This project is still a work in progress, but the landing page and the search input are complete. One of my favorite features is the autocomplete select lists for the ingredients, where the user can type in the name of an ingredient and a list of matching ingredients will appear for the user to select. The ingredients then appear as a breadcrumb below the input box and can be removed by clicking on the 'X'. I've loved working on this project and hope to finish it by the end of summer 2017.",
